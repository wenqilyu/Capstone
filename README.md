# COVID-19 Rumor Detection 

## Repository Structure

**data**: This folder contains the data used by the project. 

**notebook**: This folder is divided into three parts, the first part is data cleaning, the second part is EDA part, and the third part is model part.


## Problem Statement
The spreading rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been very high around the world. The world was in a war to fight not only a pandemic, but also an infodemic. In this project, I design a rumor detection and truth response system to combating the infodemic.

## Approach
1.Data collection: I found some COVID-19 related rumor tweets from papers and GitHub[1], and scraped the information using Twitter Hydration Tool[2]. //
2.Data processing: After successfully extracting the data, we finally generate a new COVID-19 rumor dataset with labels. Where tag=1 means that the tweets are correct information, where tag=0 means that the tweets are incorrect information. Then, we clean tweets content, removing stop words, punctuation, lemmatization, etc.//
3.Exploratory Data Analysis
4.Model
5.Truth match
